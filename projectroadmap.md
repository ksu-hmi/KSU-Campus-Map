"Setup roadmap as a task list with check boxes. Assign team members for the next two week sprint to each tasks."

[x] find related repository and evaluate it (Kay) GPS-visualization-Python repository evaluated and determined functional. Could be useful to incorporate to future plans

[x] test repository and get it running, reporting on any issues and documenting how to make it work (Mal and Kay) see above

[x] make changes to improve ksu-campus-map repo (Mal) still figuring out how to incorporate the new code and keep it functional. currently just tweaking files to make them relevant to KSU campus area.

[x] create custom google map for ksu campus with complete descriptions and building names (Mal) I did this because the generic google map info for KSU was pretty sparse. It showed how to get to campus, but anything beyond that was pretty blank. I created a custom map with names on all the buildings and roads. I plan to use this for connecting this app to the map for gps guidance.

Future changes TBD soon! Plans to incorporate highlighting searched locations on the map, and sending link to google maps for selected coordinates.
