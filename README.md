KSUNavigator is a tool used to help you locate specific locations on the KSU map. It can be difficult to find places on the map, as it is a large list. The search feature helps you find what you're looking for quickly.

Future changes for this app can include use of google maps for a guided walking route, ways to save preferred routes, route planning, and saved favorite locations.
